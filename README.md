# c++ university
This repository contains some of my university c++ practices

*All submitted projects were written from the end of 2021 to the middle of 2022. Previously, many of these projects were in different repositories, but I decided to combine them, making the old ones, with a history of changes, private.*

University: `RTU MIREA`

*You can read more about the projects in the README files inside the folders*
