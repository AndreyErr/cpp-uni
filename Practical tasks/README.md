### <a name="EightQueens">File: EightQueens</a>
__Task:__

Develop a program for placing 8 queens on a 64-cell chessboard so that none of them is under the other's fight
Branch and boundary method

---
### <a name="Huffman">File: Huffman</a>

Data compression by the Huffman method

__Task:__
Encoding a phrase by the Huffman method and decoding it back. 
The code is made on string, but it can be converted into a bit array.

---
### <a name="GrafCheck">File: GrafCheck</a>

Working with a graph

__Task:__
Determine whether the graph is connected, whether the graph is acyclic.

---
### <a name="Shannon-Fano">File: Shannon-Fano</a>

Data compression by the Shannon–Fano method

__Task:__
Encoding a phrase by the Shannon–Fano method and decoding it back. 
The code is made on string, but it can be converted into a bit array.

---
### <a name="BinaryTree">File: BinaryTree</a>

__Task:__
Create a binary search tree, the information part of which will be a symbol, make direct and symmetric traversals, search for the arithmetic mean and the length from the root to a given letter.

---
### <a name="DelAllWords">File: DelAllWords</a>

Search in the text

__Task:__
Remove all occurrences of a given word from a sentence by using the Knuth-Morris-Pratt method to search for a word in the text.

The Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) algorithm for searching for words in the text.

Input: a sentence with words and spaces, a word to delete.

The algorithm is case sensitive.

---
### <a name="DobleDelete">File: DobleDelete</a>

Search in the text

__Task:__
Remove all duplicate words in the text.

The Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) algorithm for searching for words in the text.

Input: A sentence with words and spaces.

The algorithm is case sensitive.

---
### <a name="OpenHash">File: OpenHash</a>

Hashing

__Task:__
To develop an application that uses a hash table to organize direct access to the elements of a set implemented on an array.

Basic operations: insert, delete, search, output.

Open addressing algorithm (double hashing)

Data used: the name of the institute and its code in the format xx.xx.xx

There may be execution problems in some cases, but no fixes are planned!

---
### <a name="OpenHashLin">File: OpenHashLin</a>

Hashing

__Task:__
To develop an application that uses a hash table to organize direct access to the elements of a set implemented on an array.

Basic operations: insert, delete, search, output.

Open addressing algorithm (linear probing)

Data used: the name of the institute and its code in the format xx.xx.xx

---
### <a name="HashChain">File: HashChain</a>

Hashing

__Task:__
To develop an application that uses a hash table to organize direct access to the elements of a set implemented on an array.

Basic operations: insert, delete, search, output.

Chain Hashing algorithm

Data used: bank account: account number integer 7-zn.number, full name,address

---
### <a name="BitSort">File: BitSort</a>

Bit sorting

__Task:__
Bit sorting of unique values using a vector.

I love this sorting, because it sorts an array of 10^7 unique seven-digit numbers in a minute!

---
### <a name="BitFile">Folder: BitFile</a>

Bit sorting using temporary files

__Task:__
Bit sorting of unique values by creating multiple files.

- _BitFile_ - the main "clean" file
- _BitFile_DebagVersion_ - a file with debag info that I don't want to lose

---
### <a name="OOP-tree">Folder: OOP-tree</a>

__Task:__
In this paper, it was necessary to build a model of a hierarchical system based on objects.

The first column denotes the parent, the second-the child, 3 - the type of the child object (you can name it in the code, there are 5 of them created, from 2 to 6) and the last is the status of the object (it does not affect anything, but you can always change it)

The exceptions are 1 line (the initial parent) and the last line end true (denotes the end of the tree)

### <a name="simpleProjects">Folder: simpleProjects</a>

Simple initial projects written in C++ Sapper and Tetris

These are my first, rather small c++ projects that I wrote in ~ two days each, so all the code is placed in the main section, don't kill for it :)

_These are my first projects created on pure linear programming_
